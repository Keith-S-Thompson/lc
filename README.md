Kent Landfield's `lc` command

I've retrieved several versions of the `lc` command, a tool to
categorize and list files in columns, from old `comp.sources.misc`
archives from 1990 to 1993 and gathered them into this git repository.
I've also applied a few small patches of my own so it builds on
modern systems.
