X  This directory contains the source to lc. lc is much like the ls 
X  command except it separates the types of files into groups and then
X  displays located file names to the user is a columnar fashion. 
X  
X! lc was initially implemented by myself after I became accustomed
X! to the lc command on a Mark Williams Coherent system I was running back
X! in 1984.  When I started moving to different systems I found that I did
X! not like the lack of information, flexibility and the general display 
X! that ls provided.  I have found that I am not the only one that has 
X! become feed up with ls and its jumbled output. All the people here use 
X! lc much more than they use ls. It is a locally well known fact that when
X! a new machine comes into the house, the first local software that is put 
X! on the machine is lc.  It is far from perfect but it is better than ls on 
X! a general use basis.
X  
X  lc uses three different environment variables COLS, CDPATH, and LC
X  allowing you to customize how you wish lc to perform on a default 
X  basis. COLS is used to switch the column width between 80 and 132

X! "lc"'s history goes back to 1978 when it was originally developed at the
X! University of Waterloo on a Honeywell 66/60 system. It became so popular 
X! that it was ported to Waterloo's V7 Unix systems shortly thereafter.  
X! This version is a complete re-implementation of lc and contains no 
X! University of Waterloo code.
